# Maze Generator

## Overview

The Maze Generator project visualizes the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm used to solve mazes. The project allows users to generate a maze of customizable dimensions and visualize the BFS algorithm's traversal as it finds a path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

## Features

- Generate Maze: Create a new maze of configurable dimensions (rows and columns).
- Solve Maze: Use the BFS algorithm to find a path through the maze and visualize the traversal.
- Dynamic Visualization: Observe the BFS algorithm in action with real-time updates on the maze's traversal.

## Technologies

- HTML for structure
- CSS for styling
- JavaScript for functionality and maze generation

## Getting Started

To run the Maze Generator locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/maze-generator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd maze-generator
   ```

3. **Open the Project in a Browser:**

   Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. **Set Maze Dimensions:**
   - Adjust the row and column size using the provided input fields.

2. **Generate the Maze:**
   - Click the "Generate Maze" button to create a maze with the specified dimensions.

3. **Solve the Maze:**
   - Click the "Solve Maze" button to visualize the BFS algorithm finding a path through the maze. The path will be displayed in green, and the BFS traversal will be shown in red.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the maze generator.
- `styles.css`: Includes the CSS styles for maze visualization and layout.
- `script2.js`: Implements the maze generation and BFS algorithm functionality.
